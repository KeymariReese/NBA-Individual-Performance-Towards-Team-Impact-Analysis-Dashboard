### 🔄 Process Overview

#### 1. 🧹 Data Review & Cleaning (Excel)
- Explored the raw NBA player game logs in **Excel**.
- Cleaned and formatted the data to ensure consistency.
- Identified key columns for team-based aggregation.

#### 2. 🗃️ SQL Filtering & Aggregation (MySQL Workbench)
- Grouped individual player stats by **team**.
- Calculated total **wins**, **losses**, and aggregated stats like:
  - Total points scored
  - Shooting attempts and accuracy
  - Rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals
- Filtered down to team-level insights from player-level rows.

#### 3. 📊 Power BI Visualization & Reporting
- Imported SQL results into **Power BI** for dashboarding.
- Created custom **DAX measures** for:
  - Shooting percentages (FG%, 3P%, FT%)
  - Player efficiency formulas
  - Defensive metrics (blocks + steals)
  - Win rates and game trends
- Designed a mix of **combo charts, bar charts, matrix visuals**, and **card KPIs**.
- Made the dashboard **interactive** using slicers and filters.
